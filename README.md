Within this application, you will be taken to a site with a large text area, and "Generate password" button.

Once the button is clicked, the user is asked a series of questions. 

1. How many characters would you like your password to contain?
2. Will it have lower case letters?
3. Will it have upper case letters?
4. Will it have numbers?
5. Will it have special characters?

After answering the following questions, a password will be generated for you. 

Upon clicking on generate password a second time, it will follow the same steps and ask you for your preferences again.
